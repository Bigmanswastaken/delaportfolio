      <h1 class="san" id="Aboutme">About Me</h1>
      <pre class="house"> <span class="theory">Hello, Internet!</span>  
        This is my first website where I fully dedicate myself and so that others can get an Idea of who I am as a person. 
        For starters I’m Filipino and I live in Cebu, the Queen City of the Southern Philippines. I have a great family composed of my mom, 
        dad, my sister and a lot of cousins, aunts, and uncles. Other important people in my life such as my friends also give a big impact on my 
        life. Friends I made in this new school and friends I made long ago, thing about them is they will always support you through thick and thin
        that's why I always give my 100% and respect them just like I do with my family. I also go to school in Saint Theresa’s College, previously I graduated from a 
        school worth mentioning named Blessed Trinity Achievers’ Academy where I met many of my friends who I still keep in contact with today. 
        My main hobbies are playing just about anything and exercising, this can range from video games to physical activities like badminton.
        Although I must admit I don’t really know what to do with my life at the moment and my plans for the future aren’t clear, 
        so one of the only things I’m focusing on in life currently is on my health and school. Two other important things other than family. <span class="dodge">
        Oh yea!1 </span> and one thing most definitely important about me is my unique hate of different sauces, mayo, soy sauce, ketchup you name it 
        and I’m pretty sure I might hate it. I don’t know how I got this hate for sauce but I just really don't like it.
